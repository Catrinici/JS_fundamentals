// Assignment: Deck of Cards
// Create a Card class. A card should have the following functionality:

// Each Card should have a suit ("Hearts", "Clubs", "Diamonds", "Spades")
// Each Card should have a string value (eg, "Ace", "Two", ...., "Queen", "King")
// Each Card should have a numerical value (1-13)
// Each Card should have a show method (log the card's information to the console)
// Create a Deck class. A deck should have the following functionality:

// The Deck should contain the 52 standard Cards
// The Deck should be able to shuffle
// The Deck should be able to reset
// The Deck should be able to deal a random Card
// Deal should return the Card that was dealt and remove it from the Deck
// Now create a Player class. A Player should have the following functionality:

// The Player should have a name
// The Player should have a hand (an array of cards taken from a Deck)
// The Player should be able to take a Card (use the deck.deal method)
// The Player should be able to discard a Card
