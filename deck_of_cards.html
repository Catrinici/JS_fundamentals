        // Assignment: Deck of Cards
        // Create a Card class. A card should have the following functionality:

        // Each Card should have a suit ("Hearts", "Clubs", "Diamonds", "Spades")
        // Each Card should have a string value (eg, "Ace", "Two", ...., "Queen", "King")
        // Each Card should have a numerical value (1-13)
        // Each Card should have a show method (log the card's information to the console)
        // Create a Deck class. A deck should have the following functionality:

        // The Deck should contain the 52 standard Cards
        // The Deck should be able to shuffle
        // The Deck should be able to reset
        // The Deck should be able to deal a random Card
        // Deal should return the Card that was dealt and remove it from the Deck
        // Now create a Player class. A Player should have the following functionality:

        // The Player should have a name
        // The Player should have a hand (an array of cards taken from a Deck)
        // The Player should be able to take a Card (use the deck.deal method)
        // The Player should be able to discard a Card
